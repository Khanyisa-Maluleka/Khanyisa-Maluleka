- 👋 Hi, I’m @Khanyisa-Maluleka
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a Software Development student at CodeSpace Academy, and therefore still building my skills. My journey in software development has been exciting as I learn the foundations of web development, allowing me to create and style websites. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in front-end development and eventually exploring back-end technologies to become a well-rounded developer.
- 📫 How to reach me, via email @khanyisamaluleka20@gmail.com, LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/khanyisa-maluleka-6199762b9/>
